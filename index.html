<p>     
Using Our Shared _Templates Folder in Sketch
1. Go to _Templates in Drive
2. Create an alias for the _Templates folder (right click on _Templates, choose “Create Alias”
3. In Sketch, go to: File > New for Templates > Reveal in Finder
4. Drag the alias you just made to the folder containing the folder you just opened (confusing, I know - you should be dragging the alias into a folder named “com.bohemiancoding.sketch3”) 
6. In com.bohemiancoding.sketch3, you should see, amongst other things:
- A folder named Templates
- The alias you just dragged there (_Templates alias)
7. Now, rename the Templates folder to something else (for eg, Templates.BAK). (edited)
8. Rename “_Templates alias” to Templates (edited)

Tadaaa! You’ve fooled Sketch into looking for its Templates in our common _Templates folder!</p>

<h3 id="designer-templates">Designer Templates</h3>
<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click ‘Continue to layouts’ to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3 id="creating-pages-manually">Creating pages manually</h3>
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3 id="authors-and-contributors">Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

### Resources
<h2>Style Guides and Design Systems<h2>
I know that each of us has the creation of a web style guide as one of our objectives in different capacities depending on our roles. As we begin to think about our approach for it, I’d like to share a few resources that can help us think of this as a true system of elements that work together rather than just a collection of assets.

Start by reading about Brad Frost’s Atomic Design and. He does a great job of explaining how we need to think of these systems from the ground up. Implementing this for our needs will be something that Celia and I can guide you through as we go through each element/component type.

Google’s Material Design is another good resource to help think about design elements as a system, and their corresponding Sketch sticker sheet is a good example of what I’d like us to end up having at the end of this exercise.

Here are a few style guides I like to refer to. If anyone has more examples, do share with the team.
Code for America
Lonely Planet
Mailchimp
Salesforce (Lightning Design System)
Yelp

### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
